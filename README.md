## Pihole_Influx

A couple of basic scripts for inserting pihole data into influxdb for graphing.

*pihole_influx.py* - A python script for inserting records into influxdb.

Configuration options:

```bash
HOSTNAME = "ns-01" # Pi-hole hostname to report in InfluxDB for each measurement
PIHOLE_API = "http://PI_HOLE_IP_ADDRESS_HERE/admin/api.php"
INFLUXDB_SERVER = "127.0.0.1" # IP or hostname to InfluxDB server
INFLUXDB_PORT = 8086 # Port on InfluxDB server
INFLUXDB_USERNAME = "username"
INFLUXDB_PASSWORD = "password"
INFLUXDB_DATABASE = "piholestats" # Or database name of your choice
DELAY = 600 # seconds
```

*pihole-influx.service* - A SystemD Unit File for starting pihole_influx at boot (and logging)
On Centos7, put this file in /lib/systemd/system/.

Run:

```bash
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable pihole-influx
systemctl start pihole-influx
```

To run pihole_influx.py from the command line without the startup script:

```bash
/usr/bin/python ./pihole_influx.py
```

I installed this script in /opt/pihole_influx.  If you put it somewhere else you'll have to update the systemD startup script.

NOTE: The script pauses for DELAY seconds at start because I had problems with the systemD script if it was started too early.  If you know how to fix this please submit a pull request.

### Troubleshooting
If you get the following error:

```
Traceback (most recent call last): File "./pihole_influx.py", line 11, in <module> from influxdb import InfluxDBClient
```

You'll need to install the python-influxdb module for python.  On a raspberry pi, you can do this with:

```bash
sudo apt-get install python-influxdb
```

Or on CentOS / RHEL:

```bash
yum install python-influxdb
```

---

If you get this error:

```bash
Traceback (most recent call last): File "./pihole_influx.py", line 8, in <module> import requests ImportError: No module named requests
```

You'll need to install the python-requests module.
